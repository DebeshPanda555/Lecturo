# Lecturo

Lecturo is a productivity-focused web application designed to seamlessly convert handwritten notes into structured, editable digital text. Developed using Flask and Python, the core functionality is powered by OCR (Optical Character Recognition) integration, allowing users to upload handwritten documents and receive accurate, machine-readable outputs.

The application features a minimalist and responsive frontend built with HTML and CSS, ensuring a clean user experience across devices. Users can upload scanned images or photos of handwritten notes, which are then processed through a backend pipeline involving file handling, text extraction, and structured formatting.

Lecturo demonstrates strong backend development skills, from API integration and asynchronous processing to efficient data parsing. The project highlights the practical application of machine learning APIs in real-world scenarios, making it a valuable tool for students, professionals, and researchers aiming to digitize their notes quickly and efficiently.
